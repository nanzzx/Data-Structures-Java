# Java Data Structures and Algorithms üìö

# Overview üåü

Java offers a wide range of data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage and manipulate data. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and scalable programs.

# Data Structures üìÇ

**Stack**

Description: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top. It supports operations like push (add), pop (remove), and peek (retrieve the top element).

Implementation: Utilizes the java.util.Stack class or can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

**Queue**

Description: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. It supports operations like enqueue (add), dequeue (remove), and peek (retrieve the front element).

Implementation: Utilizes the java.util.Queue interface, with implementations like LinkedList or ArrayDeque.

**Tree**

Description: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children. Trees are used in various applications like hierarchical data representation and searching.

Implementation: Java provides various tree implementations like Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.

**Graph**

Description: A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects or entities.

Implementation: Graphs can be implemented using adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, or specialized graph classes.

# Sorting Algorithms üì¶

**Selection Sort**

Description: Selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion.

Complexity: O(n^2) time complexity.

**Insertion Sort**

Description: Insertion sort iterates through the array, shifting elements one position to the right until it finds the correct position for the current element.

Complexity: O(n^2) time complexity.

**Bubble Sort**

Description: Bubble sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the array is sorted.

Complexity: O(n^2) time complexity.

**Quick Sort**

Description: Quick sort partitions the array into smaller sub-arrays around a pivot element, then recursively sorts each sub-array.

Complexity: O(n log n) average time complexity.

# Searching Techniques üîç

**Linear Search**

Description: Linear search iterates through each element of the array sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.

Complexity: O(n) time complexity.

**Binary Search**

Description: Binary search requires the array to be sorted and repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found.

Complexity: O(log n) time complexity.

# Dynamic Programming üåü

Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems. It optimizes solutions by storing the results of subproblems in a table and reusing them when needed.

# Conclusion üéâ
Java's extensive collection of data structures and algorithms provides developers with powerful tools to tackle a wide range of problems efficiently. Understanding these concepts and choosing the appropriate data structure or algorithm is crucial for writing robust and scalable Java applications.
